# Illinois Common Core CERC Creator

The Illinois Common Core Writing Standards Generator is a program that provides students in grades 6-8 with paragraph prompts based on the Common Core Writing Standards. This program is designed to help students practice their writing skills by providing them with sentence starters and blanks to fill in the rest of the paragraph.

With this program, students can easily select the Common Core Writing Standard they are currently working on and receive a paragraph prompt tailored to that standard.
