# Illinois Common Core CERC Creator
This program was designed to generate CERC formatted paragraphs based on the Illinois Common Core 8th Grade Writing Standards. 

## Usage
This program is for learning purposes only. If you decide to utilize this program for your own writing, please make sure that the paragraph generated is only for reference. Also, please note that paragraphs generated from this program may not always be accurate or even relatively cohesive because functionality is dependent on randomly choosing from different sets of arrays. While the final product may not be the most desirable one keep in mind that you can always re-run the program. The focus is not to have the program write everything for you but rather give you ideas on how to start or alter your writing.
